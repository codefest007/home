			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>
				Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.
				<br><br>
				It can be really fun and interesting to learn how to code. Being able to code is a great skill to have and it is very useful, especially because 
				coding is used in all electronic devices we use every day! Some examples are mobile phones, laptops, washing machines, television, the ticket machine at the train station and the vacuum cleaner.

		<h3 class="text-warning text-center my-3">Our curricullum</h3>
		Our curricullum is designed to simplify learning coding in a step-by-step approach. Topics are significantly broken down to help learners understand the concept.
		Our tutors engage the students once a week, but in a situation whereby the school has more students, the engagement will be twice per week.
		Pupils in
		<ul>
			<li>Year 1 to 6 take Scratch programming and then App Inventor</li>
			<li>Year 7 to 9 take Website design and</li>
			<li>Year 10 to 12 take Arduino.</li>
