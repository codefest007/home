				<p>
					Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.

					<span class="hidden-text d-none">It can be really fun and interesting to learn how to code. Being able to code is a great skill to have and it is very useful, especially because 
					coding is used in all electronic devices we use every day! Some examples are mobile phones, laptops, washing machines, television, the ticket machine at the train station and the vacuum cleaner.</span>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-2 purple">Our objective</h3>
				<p>
					At <i>CodeFest Academy</i>, we aim to equip pupils with the skills they need for the world of work, inspire more young people
					to pursue careers in computing and help them to solve problem and become logical thinkers. We don't want to live in a world where young people just consume the web.
					We want to help them actively create the content they are engaging with.

			<div class="">
				<i class="fas fa-people-arrows fa-3x purple"></i>
				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-2 purple">Who we work with</h3>
				<p>
					CodeFest is focused on reaching out to students and introducing them to computer coding/programming. in order to achieve this purpose, we partner with local schools who have the capacity to run the program.
					So, our target is primary and secondary schools. By learning coding at an early age comes with lots of benefits which should not be overlooked.

			<h3 class="text-warning text-center my-3">Our curricullum</h3>
			Our curricullum is designed to simplify learning coding in a step-by-step approach. Topics are significantly broken down to help learners understand the concept.
			Our tutors engage the students once a week, but in a situation whereby the school has more students, the engagement will be twice per week.
			Pupils in<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Year 1 to 6 will learn Scratch programming and App Inventor</li>
				<li>Year 7 to 9 will learn App Inventor and website design</li>
				<li>Year 10 to 12 will learn website design and Arduino.</li>
