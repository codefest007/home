		<h3>What is Coding?</h3>
		It can be really fun and interesting to learn how to code. Being able to code is a great skill to have and it is very useful, especially because 
		coding is used in all electronic devices we use every day! Some examples are mobile phones, laptops, washing machines, television, the ticket machine at the train station and the vacuum cleaner.
